# My-First-FPS

This is my first FPS I do. I like to use [Brackey's](https://github.com/brackeys) tutorials to create it and I hope that the idea will catch on.

------

Here you can find game and game files to see some ideas, but game is also available on [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/fps-first_personal_shooter/676618) where you can find some other games.


#### Below you can find information about the items in the game and their usefulness
-----

##### Shotgun

This weapon allows you to destroy the enemy with moderate consumption of ammunition visible on the right side.
Perfect for low and medium distances

##### Granade

This weapon has its charm in size and damage, but can easily be destroyed.
Perfect for opponents with a field around them, the grenade can stay in the field and the unaware opponent will be defeated

##### Rocket Luncher

This weapon is huge and very dangerous, taking more than 25% of your ammo when shot, but it does good damage. In just 3 shots, the enemy is defeated!

##### Chow Chow

This weapon deals both little damage and consumes little ammo. 


> I don't know why I put it in the game.

##### Medicine

Like any medicine, it has its value, replenishing health by as much as 10%, but taking all ammunition. Well, what more can we say? 
> You want medicine, get out of the money ...

##### Laser Gun

This Plasma Laser will meltdown enemys to their dead.

#### Shield Injector

This special Shield will make you invencible but it will hurt too (2% of live). While you have ammo it will give you protect.
> When ammo is full it will make explotion that will damage and throw enemys away

##### Auto Cannon
It is a momentary cannon that fires at the closest enemy, dealing 1.5 damage to enemies, unfortunately it fires a maximum of 10 bullets...


#### Similitude
