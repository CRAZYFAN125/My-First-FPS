# My-First-FPS

This is my first FPS I do. I like to use [Brackey's](https://github.com/brackeys) tutorials to create it and I hope that the idea will catch on.

------

Here you can find game and game files to see some ideas, but game is also available on [GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/fps-first_personal_shooter/676618) where you can find some other games.


#### Below you can find information about the items in the game and their usefulness
-----

##### Shotgun

This weapon allows you to destroy the enemy with moderate consumption of ammunition visible on the right side.
Perfect for low and medium distances

##### Granade

This weapon has its charm in size and damage, but can easily be destroyed.
Perfect for opponents with a field around them, the grenade can stay in the field and the unaware opponent will be defeated

##### Rocket Luncher

This weapon is huge and very dangerous, taking more than 25% of your ammo when shot, but it does good damage. In just 3 shots, the enemy is defeated!

##### Chow Chow

This weapon deals both little damage and consumes little ammo. 


> I don't know why I put it in the game.

##### Medicine

Like any medicine, it has its value, replenishing health by as much as 10%, but taking all ammunition. Well, what more can we say? 
> You want medicine, get out of the money ...

#### Similitude
